=== Snapshots

Snapshots are published automatically to https://oss.jfrog.org/[Artifactory OSS] on every successful build.
You can use them by defining this Maven repository inside
the `repositories` block in your `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
----
maven { url "https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local" }
